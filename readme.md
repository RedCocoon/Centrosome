Although I wanted to make a "read me" file with all the warnings like "DO NOT STEAL" but this is an open source project :P

**What is this?**

Centrosome is an open source tool to assists you in the process of merging multiple datapacks into one. Created by Red Cocoon.

**How do install it?**

For Windows User:
1) Put the folder "centrosome" into the "C:" Drive.
2) Add this to your environment variables "Path":
"C:\centrosome" (not including the quotes)

For Mac:
1) Please message me if anyone knows how. Discord: Cocoon#5487

For Linux:
1) Put the folder "centrosome" into /bin/ or /usr/bin
2) Restart

**How to use:**

1) Make a folder that have all the datapacks inside, unzipped, just like how you do when you put the packs in your world.
2) Make sure that only datapacks are in that folder and there's no folder named "temp".
3) Open command line.
4) Type "centrosome Path/To/The/Datapacks/"
5) Type in the mode for selective merging.
6) Everything else should happen automatically. Go grab a coffee or something.
